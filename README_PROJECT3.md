In this project I wanted to push 3D printing method to transcend its physicality. It began from my disappointment of the product that come out from 3D printers. The material for printing, in this case abs, does not give the 3D printed objects that I printed any weight, thus rendering the physicality of the object lesser in quality than what a real object constructed by traditional means with traditional material would feel. So I am trying to improve quality of an object that produced by digital method and push 3D printing further by creating 3D printed mold that I later will use to pour wax and create copies of wax sculptures.\
I started by scanning an object, in this project the object is a plastic sculpture of baby Jesus, just in time for the holiday season. I used the 3D scanning machine in the class. After 4 hours of scanning, I came back to see the result and immediately disappointed by it. All the details did not translate well into the 3D scanned model. So from there I took the model and imported it to Zbrush and began sculpting the model digitally. Then I used Rhino to create the 3D model for the mold.\
I printed the models and began pouring wax into it. Problem that I encountered was that the hand cannot be pulled out from the mold without breaking it. So currently what I have is 4 part mold, I think I need to make 6 or even 8 part mold to securely take out every part to make successful, intact was casts.\
Then another experiment is to render distorted figure of the baby Jesus, playing with perspective visual illusion.}
